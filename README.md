This project highlights the crucial role of data in understanding financial risks and revenue impact within the Big 4 accounting firms. The use of statistical correlations and data visualization techniques allows us to uncover key insights about how various factors—such as fraud detection, compliance violations, employee workload, and AI usage—affect financial performance.

Key Takeaways:
Data Reveals Hidden Patterns:

Through correlation analysis (Spearman & Kendall), we identified relationships between AI usage, risk factors, and revenue impact that might not be obvious at first glance.
Supports Data-Driven Decision-Making:

The findings help firms optimize risk management strategies by identifying which factors have the strongest influence on financial performance.
For example, the moderate correlation between employee workload and revenue impact suggests that workforce management could be a critical area for improving efficiency.
